                <p>Last updated: June 19, 2025</p>

                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By downloading or using the ChadX mobile application, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

                <h2>2. Purpose of the App</h2>
                <p>ChadX is intended for educational, motivational, and personal development purposes only. It does not provide financial, medical, legal, or psychological advice. Use of the app and reliance on any of its content is strictly at your own risk.</p>

                <h2>3. Subscriptions and Purchases</h2>
                <p>ChadX offers an optional yearly subscription (currently $49.99 USD) for access to additional tools and features. Payments and billing are handled through the App Store or Google Play. We do not process or store payment information. Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled before the renewal date.</p>

                <h2>4. No Guarantees</h2>
                <p>We make no guarantees regarding the outcomes, results, or effectiveness of the tools or content provided. Your experience and results may vary based on individual effort, context, and interpretation.</p>

                <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, ChadX and its creators shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or relating to your use of the app, including but not limited to loss of income, emotional distress, or decision-making outcomes.</p>

                <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>All content in the ChadX app and on the website—including text, design, logos, graphics, and original ideas—is the intellectual property of ChadX and its creators and may not be copied, reproduced, or redistributed without written permission.</p>

                <h2>7. Content and Language</h2>
                <p>ChadX contains no explicit or adult content. Infrequent use of mild slang may appear in a censored form for expressive effect (e.g., “ba***rd”). This content is considered suitable for general audiences.</p>

                <h2>8. Changes to the App</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to update, modify, or remove features from the app at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the app after changes are made constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

                <h2>9. Termination</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the app at our discretion if we believe you have violated these terms or engaged in misuse.</p>

                <h2>10. Privacy</h2>
                <p>We do not collect or store personal data. Please refer to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for more information about how data is handled within the app.</p>
