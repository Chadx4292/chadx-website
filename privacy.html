                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>Last updated: June 19, 2025</p>

                <p><strong>ChadX</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data when you use the ChadX mobile application and website.</p>

                <h2>1. No Personal Data Collected</h2>
                <p>ChadX does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Your identity, usage patterns, and activity remain completely private. All app data is processed and stored locally on your device and is not shared with us or any third party.</p>

                <h2>2. Subscription and Payments</h2>
                <p>ChadX offers an optional yearly subscription of <strong>$49.99 USD</strong>, which unlocks exclusive access to the Tools section. This subscription is purely for added functionality and is not required to access the free core content of the app.</p>
                <p>All transactions are securely handled by the App Store (Apple) or Google Play (Android). ChadX does not process or store any payment information directly.</p>

                <h2>3. Restore Purchases</h2>
                <p>If you previously purchased a subscription, you can use the in-app <strong>Restore Purchases</strong> button to regain access. This feature verifies your purchase using your Apple or Google account credentials. No data is sent to ChadX servers.</p>

                <h2>4. No Cloud Backup</h2>
                <p>ChadX does not offer cloud backups or account-based syncing at this time. All data is stored only on your device. Deleting the app or resetting your device may result in data loss unless your device itself is backed up through your operating system.</p>

                <h2>5. No Advertising or Analytics</h2>
                <p>We do not serve ads or use any analytics tools. ChadX is designed for focus and clarity, with no tracking of user behavior or data collection in any form.</p>

                <h2>6. Language and Content Rating</h2>
                <p>ChadX does not include mature or explicit content. All topics—such as wealth, mindset, personal growth, and energy—are presented in an educational and motivational context.</p>
                <p>In rare cases, light slang may appear in a clearly censored format (e.g., “ba***rd”) for expressive or humorous effect. These instances are infrequent, inoffensive, and suitable for a general audience.</p>

                <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
                <p>ChadX is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If you believe your child is using ChadX without your consent, please contact us immediately.</p>

                <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at:</p>
                <p><a href="mailto:support@chadx.app">support@chadx.app</a></p>

                <p>By using ChadX, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the app.</p>
